# MLAgentsUnity
 
I'm using the MLAgents tool in Unity to impliment machine learning in a virtual environment. To start off, I am follwing tutorials, implimenting them, and taking notes.

4/2/2022 - I used the introduction to MLAgents github projects to run a model in a scene, those clips are in the "Clips" folder. Next I will follow a tutorial which uses ML agents on penguins.
